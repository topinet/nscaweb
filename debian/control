Description: Nagios core addon to submit host and service checks over http(s)
 NSCAweb
 =======
 .
 What?
 -----
 .
 NSCAweb is a Nagios core based monitoring solution addon which allows you to
 easily submit (passive) host and service checks over http(s) to the Nagios
 external command file. It aims to be a better,more feature rich alternative
 than the classic NSCA daemon.
 .
 NSCAweb has following features:
 .
  - http(s) as transport makes it more friendly in a firewalled environment.
  - SSL encryption when desired.
  - Supports multiline plugin & performance output.
  - Accepts data coming over http or from local named pipes.
  - Submit data to many types of destinations: named pipes (nagios.cmd), 
    NSCAweb, NRDP or a file.
  - Loadbalance and failover between multiple urls per destination.
  - Duplicate and forward passive check results to an "unlimited" amount of
    destinations.
  - Submit messages to 1 destination or all destinations depending on the url
    messages are send to.
  - Simultaneous local and remote delivery.
  - Each destination has an independent, dedicated thread and queue.
  - Buffering of unavailable destinations and resubmitting when destination
    comes available to prevent data loss.
  - Builtin, multiuser authentication.
  - Trivial to submit check results using http post.
  - Submit check results in bulk or one by one.
  - Use curl as a client from the command line.
